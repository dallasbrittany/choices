# choices

A (very) simple choose your own adventure game engine for experimenting in Rust.

## Future Improvements

- Don't hard-code the story that loads; instead, allow loading from anything in story_maps and display the choices for the main menu
- Much better error-handling
- Add unit tests
- Check the JSON story for validity when it loads (missing links, invalid values, etc.)
- Write a utility that helps you build the story in the correct JSON format
- Turn this into a GUI app
